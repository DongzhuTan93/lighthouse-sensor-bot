Analyze the ferries.json file and provide insights on:
1. Compare the installed power and capacity of different ferries
2. Analyze the age and specifications of propulsion systems
3. Identify patterns in engine configurations
4. Compare vessel sizes and their passenger car equivalent capacities

Focus particularly on:
- Power to capacity ratios
- Age of equipment (especially engines and propulsion systems)
- Differences in propulsion types
- Size efficiency (comparing length/breadth to capacity)

Please provide specific data points and statistics to support your analysis.
