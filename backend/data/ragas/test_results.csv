What is the total fuel cost for route A in January 2024?,12345.67,"To find the total fuel cost for route A in January 2024, we need to:

1. Identify the tables and columns that contain information about fuel costs, routes, and the dates of those costs.
2. Filter the data for route A and for the month of January 2024.
3. Aggregate the fuel costs to compute the total for that specific timeframe and route.

Let's examine the `semantic_model` to find the relevant tables and columns.",,False,True
What is the average speed of ferry X on route B?,25.3,"To determine the average speed of ferry X on route B, we will need to perform the following steps:

1. Identify the table(s) that contain information about ferry speeds and routes.
2. Filter the data to focus on ferry X and route B.
3. Calculate the average speed for the given ferry and route.

Firstly, let's check the semantic model to identify the relevant tables and columns. Let's assume we have a table that records ferry speeds and another for routes.

### Semantic Model Analysis
Assuming these possible tables from the semantic model:

- **FerryTrips**: Contains columns such as `ferry_id`, `route_id`, `speed`, and possibly other trip details.
- **Ferries**: Contains ferry details like `ferry_id`, `ferry_name`.
- **Routes**: Provides route details including `route_id`, `route_name`.

Based on these assumptions, we'll proceed to determine how to get the journey details for ferry X on route B.

### Steps to Generate Query
1. Join the `FerryTrips` table with `Ferries` to filter trips involving ferry X.
2. Join with `Routes` to select only those trips on route B.
3. Calculate the average speed.

Let's begin by making sure that the necessary tables are available. We will start by checking the tables.",,False,True
