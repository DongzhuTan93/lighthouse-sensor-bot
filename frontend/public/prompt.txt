"Perform a cost-benefit analysis for maintaining current trip frequencies versus potential savings from reduced fuel consumption during low demand. Columns fuelcons_outbound/inbound_l contains fuel consumption value. passenger_car_equivalent_outbound/inbound is how busy the trip was. \
By looking in the schedule table for this route, suggest which adjustment to the timetable should be made based on the demand patterns, propose a more efficient schedule for the Ljuster√∂leden route to minimize fuel consumption while maintaining service quality. \
Provide recommendations for adjusting the number of trips during low-demand periods to save fuel. \
Estimate potential cost savings over a year if low-demand trips are reduced by 20%."
